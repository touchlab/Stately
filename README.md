# Stately

Stately is a state utility library to facilitate state management in Kotlin Multiplatform. It was originally written to facilitate development with the strict Kotlin/Native memory model. As of Kotlin 1.7.20, the strict model is deprecated, and the [releveant modules of Stately have also been deprecated](deprecated) but are still published and available.

Stately currently provides concurrencly primitives and concurrent collections. 

## stately-concurrency

`stately-concurrency` includes some concurrency support classes. These include a set of `Atomicxxx` classes, a `Lock`, a `ThreadLocal` container, a `Synchronizable` type, and a class `ThreadRef` that allows you to hold a thread id.

Much of the functionality of this module is similar to [atomic-fu](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.atomicfu). They differ in some ways, so while they both cover much of the same ground, Stately's version still has some use.

`ThreadRef` is unique to Stately. It allows you to capture a reference to the id of the thread in which it was created, and ask if the current thread is the same. Just FYI, it does *not* keep a reference to the actual thread. Just an id. Usage looks like this:

```kotlin
fun useRef(){
  val threadRef = ThreadRef()
  threadRef.same() // <- true
  backgrundThread {
    threadRef.same() // <- false
  }
}
```

The `Synchronizable` type allows us to use the JVM's `synchronized` but in common, and with Kotlin/Native which doesn't natively support it. 

```kotlin
class MyMutableData(private var count: Int = 0) : Synchronizable() {
    fun add() {
        synchronize { count++ }
    }

    val myCount: Int
        get() = synchronize { count }
}
```

Your type should extend `Synchronizable`, which on the JVM is typealiased to `Any`. Then you can use `synchronize` as in the example above. 

### Config

```groovy
commonMain {
    dependencies {
        implementation("co.touchlab:stately-concurrency:2.0.0")
    }
}
```

## stately-concurrent-collections

A set of relatively simple mutable collections that are thread safe.

```kotlin
val list = ConcurrentMutableList<Int>()
val list.add(42)
```

### Config

```groovy
commonMain {
    dependencies {
        implementation("co.touchlab:stately-concurrent-collections:2.0.0")
    }
}
```
